    "## Brief Description of Dataset\n",
    "This dataset is designed to train a model for the platform Lumora, which aims to support Filipino artisans. It is a table of product listings, with each row representing a unique handcrafted item.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "The objective is to develop a multi-label NLP classifier to automatically assign relevant categories and stylistic attributes to new product listings on the Lumora C2C e-commerce platform. The model will improve product discoverability by generating tags (e.g., cute, crochet, pastel, minimalist) that allow the Smart Search feature to find items even with varied or imperfect user queries.\n",
